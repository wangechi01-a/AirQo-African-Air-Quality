# AirQo-African-Air-Quality-Prediction-Challenge

# Overview

In this challenge, you are asked to estimate PM2.5 levels from satellite observations based on Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) for eight cities in seven African countries - Lagos, Accra, Nairobi, Yaounde, Bujumbura, Kisumu, Kampala, and Gulu - with varying ground monitoring resolutions, using appropriate machine learning algorithms. Ground-based observations in the selected cities will be used to validate the satellite estimates.

# Aim
The objective of the project is to estimate PM2.5 levels from satellite observations based on Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) for eight cities in seven African countries i.e., Kampala, Lagos, Accra, Nairobi, Yaounde, Bujumbura, Kisumu, and Gulu. PM2.5 refers to atmospheric particulate matter that has a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers and is one of the most harmful air pollutants. PM2.5 is a common measure of air quality that normally requires ground-based sensors to measure.

# Importance of the Challenge

Expanding Predictions: Integrating satellite data allows us to extend air quality predictions to areas without ground sensors. This expansion provides a more comprehensive view of air quality, ensuring that even remote or underserved regions are monitored effectively.

Data Fusion: By combining satellite radar data with ground-based sensor readings, we create a more robust and accurate air quality prediction model. This fusion of data sources leads to better predictions and helps in understanding the complex dynamics of air pollution.

Public Health Impact: Accurate air quality predictions are crucial for public health. They enable timely interventions and raise awareness in regions prone to poor air quality, helping to mitigate health risks and improve the overall well-being of the population.

# Technologies Used

Python: Used Python for its powerful capabilities in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building machine learning models. Python's extensive libraries and tools make it an ideal choice for handling and analyzing large datasets.

Satellite Data Processing: Utilized specialized tools and libraries to process and extract relevant information from Sentinel 5P satellite radar data. This step is crucial for transforming raw satellite data into meaningful inputs for our models.

Machine Learning Models: Implemented advanced regression models in this case Lightgbm regressor to predict air quality readings. By using both satellite data and ground-based sensor data, the moddel provided more accurate and reliable predictions, helping us understand and address air quality issues more effectively.
